# Unsupervised-Learning-project
This is a project for exploring different clustering methods and their effect on credit cards dataset.
in this project, I've explored kmeans, agglomerative clustering , hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN
for each method, I've created a function for visualization :
dendogram → for hierarichal clustering 
elbow method → for both kmeans and agglomerative clustering

first I made a minimal EDA for the data and preprocessing and applied the scaling method to normalize the data
second I've visualized the kmeans with different k -values using the elbow method
third I've applied PCA and visualized its effect of kmeans 

I've applied these three steps for agglomerative clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN with the appropriate visualization plots 

this is the project for the machine learning-2 course for ITI AI-PRO professional 9-month program
