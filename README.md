# Unsupervised-Learning-project
This is a project for exploring different clustering methods and their effect on credit cards dataset.
in this project I've explored kmeans, agglomorative clustering , hierarichal clustering and DBSCAN
for each method I've created a function for visualization :
dendogram → for hierarichal clustering 
elbow method → for both kmeans and agglomorative clustering

first I've made a minimal EDA for the data and preprocessing and applied scaling method to normaliza the data
second I've visualized te kmeans with different k -values using elbow method
third I've applied PCA and visualized its effect of kmeans 

I've applied these three steps for agglomorative clustering , hieraichal clustering and DBSCAN with the appropriate visualization plots 

this is the project for machine learning-2 course for ITI AI-PRO professional 9-months program
